Github account was recently created for my class assignment.
Created a repository titled "Jroling13.github.io". I also downloaded the desktop version of GitHub and cloned my folder to the hard drive.
I downloaded the GitHub desktop app. After that I signed in, then I hit the "+" icon, and selected " clone a repository ". I selected the jroling13.github.io repository and cloned it to a newly created folder on my hard drive. Then I selected " clone repository " to download a copy of my repository to the folder.
